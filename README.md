# deadSwitch
Python based dead man switch


deadSwitch is an experimental python project designed to wipe your internet browsing history upon failure to provide proof of life. proof of life is determined by sending an email to a designated gmail address with the subject "I'm Alive" once every 24 hour period. failure to do so will result in you being assumed dead, and your history wiped in order to protect your dignity.

At it's current state, the project is incomplete.
